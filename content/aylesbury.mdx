### Description

A dropbox-style file sharing system for the Aylesbury project contributing organisations.

### More Details

I built my own whitelabel file upload platform based on a jQuery File Uploader. The project allowed major collaboration between project architects, councils and third-party organisations to solve the classic problem of sharing large files. I added many more dropbox-style features and file and user management using OO-PHP and jQuery.
